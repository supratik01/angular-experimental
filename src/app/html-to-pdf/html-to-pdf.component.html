                        <p>The utilities sector has generally been viewed as a “safe haven” by investors during periods of market volatility and slowing growth. This is due to the sector’s traditional defensive nature and stable revenues during all phases
                            of the business cycle. However, as the financial risks from climate change grow, some utilities may be challenged to generate a steady rate of return for shareholders. Competitors with fewer risks related to fossil fuels may
                            outperform peers by taking advantage of greater opportunities for renewable energy and technology development.</p>

                        <p>We believe a comprehensive understanding of the risks and rewards associated with climate change is critical for investors to assess and manage portfolio risk. In the coming decades, businesses will face increasing pressure to
                            reduce their emissions as countries around the world pledge to become carbon neutral by 2050. There will likely be a policy response that will put some companies at risk if they are unwilling or unable to align with the goal
                            of “net-zero.”</p>

                        <h4><strong>A Multitude of Risks</strong></h4>

                        <p>Organizations that fail to adapt to climate change face a host of potential risks. &nbsp;The public, for example, generally associates climate change with physical risks, which is true, but incomplete. Customers and investors are
                            also pressuring publicly traded companies to explain how they plan to transition to a clean energy future. International and regional regulatory authorities are demanding specific disclosures regarding how utilities plan to
                            meet net-zero goals. Meanwhile, power demand continues to rise in concert with the buildout of electric cars.</p>

                        <p>Physical risk. Climate change is associated with rising temperatures and an increase in the severity of natural disasters. This has resulted in economic loss for some businesses due to damaged infrastructure and disruptions to
                            supply chains and operations. In the last two years alone, the US experienced more than 40 weather-related incidences that resulted in at least $1 billion in damage per occurrence.</p>

                        <p>The utilities sector has the highest exposure to physical risk, leading other capital-intensive sectors, such as industrial manufacturing, oil and gas and real estate. &nbsp;More extreme hurricanes, wildfires and heatwaves continue
                            to impact every aspect of the grid, from generation, transmission, and distribution, to demand for electricity. For many utilities, this has meant reduced efficiency, higher operating expenses and more frequent power outages.
                            Capital expenditures to maximize infrastructure resiliency in the face of climate change is becoming a critical component of sustainable business models.</p>

                                <p><strong>Transition risk</strong>. The financial risk associated with an uncertain path to a decarbonized economy is called transition risk. The electric utility and transportation sectors, which make up at least half of
                                    all US carbon emissions, are the most exposed to transition risks, which range from reduced access to financial capital to new federal and state regulations. &nbsp;Insurance-related risks include higher operating costs
                                    and insurance premiums associated with compliance, increased carbon emission pricing, climate-related reporting requirements and restrictions on existing products and services. An increasing number of banks and insurers
                                    say they will no longer back companies with shares of coal generation above 30%.</p>

                                <p><strong>Regulatory risk.</strong> The SEC proposed new climate-related disclosures in March 2022 in recognition that climate risks can pose significant financial risks to companies, and investors need reliable information
                                    about climate risks to make informed investment decisions. The proposed rules would require disclosures on Form 10-K about a company’s governance, risk management, and strategy regarding climate-related risks. Moreover,
                                    the proposal would require disclosure of any targets or commitments made by a company, as well as its plan to achieve those targets and its transition plan, if it has them.</p>

                                <h4>Managing Climate Risk &amp; Opportunity</h4>

                                <p>At Fiduciary Trust International, we believe climate change is an important factor to consider when assessing risk and opportunity in a portfolio. Our goals is to weigh the investment implications of government responses
                                    to climate change in the form of new federal and state regulations, public investment and carbon taxes, as well as shifts in consumer and investment sentiment and rising costs from natural disasters.</p>

                                <p>Companies at the forefront of change are already setting ambitious climate goals and investing in more sustainable solutions and incorporating stakeholder considerations in their business models. &nbsp;Progress is evident
                                    in capital investments to ensure more durable infrastructure and a greater willingness from companies to incorporate climate factors in company disclosures. This includes emissions (both direct and in its supply chain),
                                    exposure to physical risks such as flooding and wildfires, and climate mitigation and adaption measures to address these risks.</p>

                                <h4>Applying a Climate Change Lens to Utility Investment Decisions</h4>

                                <p>When assessing the utilities sector, we start by looking at publicly available information. Company disclosures are used to determine the percentage and growth potential of renewables in the business model and whether there
                                    are capital investments planned in low emissions products, services and energy efficiency management.&nbsp;</p>

                                <p>We also monitor the carbon intensity of operations, both absolute and relative to peers, and the amount of revenues derived from providing clean energy solutions, such as wind and solar power. Companies may have a high
                                    carbon intensity but either reflect high transition potential or play a significant role in reducing real world emissions by developing low carbon solutions, highlighting the challenges posed to investors when assessing
                                    climate risk in a portfolio.</p>

                                <p>We believe proactive utility companies will enhance their return potential over time as they work to manage the downside risks inherent in climate change, access new growth opportunities and customer segments and improve
                                    their economic and physical resilience.</p>

                                <p>1.&nbsp;The utilities sector faces extensive financial risks from climate change, based on the sector’s overreliance on carbon-intensive power generation. In addition, its aging plant and equipment are highly sensitive
                                    to weather-related disruptions.</p>

                                <p>2.&nbsp;Investors and other stakeholders are pressuring electric utilities to demonstrate they can adapt to and thrive in a low carbon economy.</p>

                                <p>3.&nbsp;Utilities that decrease fossil fuel dependence and invest in clean energy solutions are realizing higher margins and earnings per share growth. Adaptability has boosted their competitive advantage and improved return
